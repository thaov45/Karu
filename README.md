# Karu
A small desktop mobile phone control wifi car using NodeMCU ESP8266 that can avoid edge. However, it would look too boring so I add expression to her through an OLED

---
### Working updates:
* Currently working on the driving part
* Using 2 servos instead of motors since I want to keep it as small as possible (would be a 2 wheels car)
---
### Expressions:
Karu will have 3 mains expressions:
1. "Happy" face when running
2. "Wake up" face when power on
3. "Attention" when detects an edge, and then "look underneath" while moving backward

Note: The eyes got inspired from an AI pet names "Emo". I drew all the image I need, converted it to bitmap image, and then converted it again to hexadecimal code.
